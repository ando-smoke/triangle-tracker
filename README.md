Triangle Tracker
======================

Takes in three positive integers and determines whether or not they
could make up valid side lengths of a triangle. If not valid, the user
is informed of the result. Otherwise, the triple of side lengths are
placed with the column corresponding to the appropriate triangle type
(i.e. equilateral, isosceles or scalene).

Installation
------------

Clone this project onto your local system and open the enclosed
triangle-tracker.html file in your preferred web browser. Of note, a
browser utilizing HTML5 is required for proper data validation of
inputs (i.e. nonnegative integers are required for all three fields).

Usage
-----

Enter in positive integers representing three side lengths of a
potential triangle. Next, click on the Evaluate button for the
result as to whether or not the side lengths constitute a valid triangle.
